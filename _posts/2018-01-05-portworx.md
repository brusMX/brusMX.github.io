title: Deploying an Azure Kubernetes cluster with Portworx
---

In this post we illustrate how to deploy Portworks on Kubernetes on Azure using the ACS engine.

## Requirements

- Bash 
- Azure CLI 2.0 you can install it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), or use the Azure Cloud Shell in your browser (I am currently using `azure-cli (2.0.23)`)
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Installation) for parsing data from json responses on bash.
- Azure subscription where you are the owner or have a Service Principal with at least Contributor role to the subscription.
- SSH keys in your local machine
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for file editing
- 

## Setting up the environment

1. Download the latest version of the `acs-engine` in your computer. At the moment of writing this article, I am using v0.6.0 from their [list of releases](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/releases/latest). If you are using Mac OS X, you can type in the following commands from your terminal:

    ```bash
    mkdir portworx-acs
    cd portworx-acs
    curl -L https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/releases/download/v0.11.0/acs-engine-v0.11.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar zx
    cp acs-engine-v0.11.0-darwin-amd64/acs-engine .
    chmod +x acs-engine
    rm -rf acs-engine-v0.11.0-darwin-amd64/
    ```
    Just if you would like to check, the MD5 sum of the binary is the following: `53371680926b19e74bef391be6cf2037`.


1. Generate a Service Principal for your deployment, you can use my [getAzureServicePrincipal.sh](https://gist.github.com/brusMX/bab2224dc1b0c26d3aef4799cb97c045) file to obtain it:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brusMX/bab2224dc1b0c26d3aef4799cb97c045/raw/bf05884b5aeca9ae0c455af3ce0e695ec372cccc/getAzureServicePrincipal.sh
    chmod +x getAzureServicePrincipal.sh
    ./getAzureServicePrincipal.sh
    ```

    You will be using `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` in the next step, so keep them close. Also, remember that if you create a Service Principal for a subscription that was not the default one, you will have to run the following command:

    ```bash
    az account set -s <<CHOSEN SUBSCRIPTION ID>>
    ```

    Also, you can copy paste the variables suggested by the previous script so you can use them later as input to the json file we are going to deploy


1. Set up environment variables that will define where the cluster will be located:

    1. Choose a location (you can choose any valid location):

        ```bash
        export LOC=southcentralus
        ```

    1. Name your Resource Group

        ```bash
        export RG_NAME=$(mktemp portworx-XXXXXXX)
        ```

    1. Obtain the dns name from your json file

        ```bash
        export DNS_NAME=$(mktemp portworx-XXXXXXX)
        ```

1. Create your resource group where everything will be deployed (if something goes bad, you can always delete the whole RG and start again)

    ```bash
    az group create --name "${RG_NAME}" --location $LOC
    ```


1. Create the json file that will be used to deploy the cluster. If you have all the right environment variables set up, you can copy paste the following command:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOT >> portworx-cluster.json
    {
        "apiVersion": "vlabs",
        "properties": {
            "orchestratorProfile": {
                "orchestratorType": "Kubernetes",
                "orchestratorVersion": "1.7.9",
                "kubernetesConfig":{
                    "enableRbac": true
                }
            },
            "masterProfile": {
            "count": 1,
            "dnsPrefix": "`echo $DNS_NAME`",
                "vmSize": "Standard_D2_v2"
            },
            "agentPoolProfiles": [
            {
                "name": "agent",
                "count": 3,
                "vmSize": "Standard_D2_v2",
                "storageProfile" : "ManagedDisks",
                "diskSizesGB": [128, 128, 128, 128],
                "availabilityProfile": "AvailabilitySet"
            }
            ],
            "linuxProfile": {
            "adminUsername": "`echo $USERNAME`",
            "ssh": {
                "publicKeys": [
                {
                    "keyData": "`cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`"
                }
                ]
            }
            },
            "servicePrincipalProfile": {
            "clientId": "`echo $AZURE_CLIENT_ID`",
            "secret": "`echo $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`"
            }
        }
    }
    EOT
    ```

1. Make sure that the variables **dnsPrefix**, **adminUsername**, **keyData**, **clientId** and **secret** were populated. If not open the file with VSCode and edit it with the right info: `code portworx-cluster.json` and update the file accordingly.

    1. Make sure to use an unique name for `dnsPrefix`.
    1. Paste the content of your public SSH key into `keydata`.
    1. Put the value of `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` on `clientId`.
    1. Update the value of `secret` with `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`


## Deploying the cluster

Now that we have all our files in order, we can proceed to use ACS-Engine to create the artifacts of our cluster and deploy them.

1. Create artifacts with ACS-Engine, you will see a folder called `_output` after you run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./acs-engine generate portworx-cluster.json
    ```

1. Deploy your cluster to Azure with the CLI

    ```bash
    az group deployment create --resource-group="${RG_NAME}" --template-file="_output/${DNS_NAME}/azuredeploy.json" --name="${DNS_NAME}" --parameters @_output/${DNS_NAME}/azuredeploy.parameters.json
    ```

## Connect to your cluster and test it out

After the cluster has been succesfully deployed we can obtain our kubeconfig file and start interacting with it.

1. Obtain `.kubeconfig` file

    ```bash
    scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $DNS_NAME.$LOC.cloudapp.azure.com:/home/$USERNAME/.kube/config config-$DNS_NAME
    ```

1. Paste this file in your the. For this case I will create an extra file so you don't have to worry about your previous k8s config files.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.kube
    mv config-$RG_DNS_NAME ~/.kube
    export  KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-$DNS_NAME
    ```

1. Confirm that your cluster is up. You can start running the following commands and make sure that everything is working the way it should be:

    ```bash
    kubectl cluster-info

    Kubernetes master is running at https://k8scluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com
    Heapster is running at https://k8scluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
    KubeDNS is running at https://k8scluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns/proxy
    kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://k8scluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy
    tiller-deploy is running at https://k8scluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/tiller-deploy/prox
    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes

    NAME                    STATUS    AGE       VERSION
    k8s-agent-25202797-0    Ready     44s       v1.9
    k8s-master-25202797-0   Ready     52s       v1.9
    ```

## Deploying Portworx

1. Download the following file:

    ```bash
    VER=$(kubectl version --short | awk -Fv '/Server Version: /{print $3}')
    curl -o px-spec.yaml "http://install.portworx.com?c=$DNS_NAME&k=etcd://10.240.0.4:2379&kbver=$VER"
    kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml
    ```

    ```bash
    # Monitor the portworx pods

    kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system -l name=portworx


    # Monitor Portworx cluster status

    PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    kubectl exec $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
    ```
