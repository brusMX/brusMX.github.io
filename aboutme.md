My full name is **Bruno Medina Bolaños Cacho**, A.K.A.
**BrusMX** and, I'm a passionate man committed to freedom... and software.

I come from a small beautiful city called 
[Oaxaca](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca)
located in southwestern Mexico. In this sensual and mystical 
place, we eat [tlayudas](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/tlayuda) filled with 
[chapulines](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapulines) and we drink
[mezcal](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal)
with a lime covered in hot chili
[worm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguey_worm) salt.

## My strengths

- **Highly Experienced.**
I have more than 10 years of real life experience in Software design, development and continuous deployment.
I have provided happiness to my clients through quality software with more than 20 projects. <br/>
A little advice for you guys out there: *Adopt DevOps and stop firefighting.*

- **Cloud oriented.**
I have been doing web and mobile apps consuming Cloud Services for over 8 years. At first, I had a Rackspace VPS (remember?) running our APIs and websites with Apache.
Then, I moved to AWS with nginx, I even had my own git server (even before github was cool :P). At the same time, I had a couple of python apps running on Google App Engine.
<br/>And now, I have migrated to Microsoft Azure. It works great!

- **Microsoft Azure Expert.**
SkyAlert is a popular app in Mexico that sends a notification whenever one of their 55 sensors (placed all over the country) detects an earthquake.
This notification, containing the location and intesnsity of the seism, reaches out to hundreds of thousands of mobile devices.<br/>
Well, I was the architect for this project and I designed all the services to live on Azure.<br/>
